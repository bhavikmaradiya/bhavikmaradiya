    Turning chaos into code — void into meaning.
  </em>

🧠 **I philosophize, therefore I code.**  
Welcome to the intersection of software engineering, existentialist.

### 🛠 What I Build With
- **Languages:** Kotlin | Dart 
- **Frameworks:** Jetpack Compose | Flutter | Ktor
- **Tools I vibe with:** Android Studio, Melos, Firebase, GitHub Actions, Isar, GraphQL

### 🧭 What Guides Me
- Jean-Paul Sartre, Nietzsche, Camus
- Code is absurd — we give it meaning.
- Resisting the heat death of the mind, with one more `sealed class`.

### 🌀 Projects are my playground:
- 📱 Android & Flutter Apps  
- 🌐 Backend APIs with Ktor  
- 🔁 Synchronization engines, real-time tracking, and offline-first design  
- 🧪 Clean Architecture & TDD devotee

### 🛼 When not coding...
- I’m probably **roller skating into the void**,  
- Or lost in a book on **psychology & human behavior**.
