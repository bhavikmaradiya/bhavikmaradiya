### 🛠 What I Build With
- **Languages:** Kotlin | Dart 
- **Frameworks:** Jetpack Compose | Flutter | Ktor
- **Tools I vibe with:** Android Studio, Intellij IDEA, Warp

### 🧭 What Guides Me
- Kafka, Nietzsche, Camus
- Code is absurd — we give it meaning.
- Resisting entropy of the mind, with one more `Scaffold`.

### 🌀 Projects are my playground:
- 📱 Composing Android & Flutter Apps  
- 🌐 Backend APIs with Ktor  
- 🔁 Synchronization engines, real-time tracking, and offline-first design  
- 🧪 Clean Architecture, MVI

### 🛼 When not coding...
- I’m probably **roller skating into the void**,  
- Or lost somewhere in philosophizing**.
